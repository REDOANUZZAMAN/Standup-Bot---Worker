## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Triggering

```bash

1. Workflow is Active (toggle in top-right)
2. Webhook URL is correct in Lonescale
3. Webhook path matches: fe426a62-eee5-4fed-bc74-45d4ac09b338-lonescale
4. Test with manual webhook execution
```

### Email Not Found

```bash
# Expected behavior:
- Dropcontact may not have data for all contacts
- Workflow creates LinkedIn outreach task as fallback
- No workflow failure, continues execution
```

### HubSpot Duplicate Contacts

```bash
# Prevention measures:
1. Workflow searches by email first
2. Uses HubSpot's native deduplication
3. Update operation if contact exists
4. Enable "Continue on Fail" for edge cases
```

### Missing Slack Notifications

```bash
# Verify:
1. Slack OAuth token is valid
2. Bot is invited to target channels
3. Channel names match exactly
4. Check n8n execution log for errors
```

### Lemlist Campaign Errors

```bash
# Common issues:
1. Campaign ID is incorrect
2. Email format is invalid
3. Lead already exists in campaign
4. API rate limits reached
```

## üìù Best Practices

### 1. Test in Sandbox First
- Use test webhook data
- Verify all integrations work
- Check data mapping is correct

### 2. Monitor Regularly
- Review n8n execution logs weekly

### 4. Maintain Data Quality
